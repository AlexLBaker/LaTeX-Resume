# LaTeX-Resume

There are two class files provided, cream_class.cls and white_class.cls which change the background color. When updating the .tex file with your information, change the class file on line 3 in the curly brackets to whichever color you want the background of the resume to be.

Thanks for checking out this project, I hope you find it useful for your endeavors.

Best of luck,

Alexander Baker.
